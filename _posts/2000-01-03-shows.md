###*I have lots of experience with:*

##MAGIC, COMEDY, JUGGLING, ESCAPES, PICK-POCKETING, MIND READING, AND MORE!

The best way to choose from all the great San Francisco magicians is to read
their reviews on Yelp, watch their videos on Youtube, and call them on the
phone to get a feel for their personality. Ask a lot of questions and if you
feel there is a good connection, that they explained what they do
clearly, and they understand your needs, then you have found your
entertainer.

###*I offer:*

- **Stand-Up Show** - I can do a comedy magic show that lasts from 5 to 60 minutes (to fill the time that is best for your needs).
- **Master of Ceremonies** - I can host, MC, moderate a panel discussion, be your auctioneer, and even be a ringmaster to keep your event running smoothly.
